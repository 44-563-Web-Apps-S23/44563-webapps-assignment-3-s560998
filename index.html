                <b>Basketball</b> is a team sport in which two teams of five players each attempt to score points against the other by launching a ball through a 300 cm high hoop.
                <b>Both indoor and outdoor courts</b> are used to play it. I really enjoy this sport because of the exciting competition between the two teams.
